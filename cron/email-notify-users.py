<p>Dear Faculty Organiser,<p>

<p>Many thanks to you and your College for being a part of the IIT Bombay,Spoken Tutorial Software training program. You have contributed in a great way to its mega success. <p>

<p>In August 2018 we informed you about the Training Policy change namely colleges will need to make a Payment/annual User fee of Rs.25000/- in order to continue the Spoken Tutorial Training. Many of you have immediately responded positively and made the payment. <u>To continue to benefit from the Software Training courses we offer - Payment is a must.  </u> </p>

<p>We wish to inform you that we have moved to a continual payment system wherein <b><u>Colleges get a full 12 months benefit from their date of payment. Eg. Jan 28th 2019 to Jan 27th 2020 etc.  </u></b> I would urge all colleges who are not in the program to come in and see what benefits they are getting for Rs.25000/-. There is NO OTHER course with this standard, this level of flexibilty and at this low cost per student.</p>

<p>One consideration from our end is related to the Test taking - Colleges who had done tests but were unable to download the certificates because colleges were disabled, we will activate those colleges for a short period of time, so that you can download the students certificates. For this you can contact your state training managers.</p>

<p>We guarantee our continued high-quality services to all. If you have questions, don't hesitate to contact the Training Coordinator of your respective state.</p>

<p><b>Yours Sincerely, <br>
Shyama Iyer <br>
National Coordinator - Training Spoken Tutorial, IIT Bombay <br>
NMEICT, MHRD, Govt. Of India<br>
</b></p>
