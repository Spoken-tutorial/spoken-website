Bulk Trainings

It is necessary for all students in the Institute to get the opportunity to take Spoken Tutorial based software training. For this please spread the awareness about the Trainings in other departments amongst the Faculty. You can also request the Principal to send out a circular to all. For your department prepare a calendar/time-table to organise Trainings for all the student batches in a systematic way. Send us the confirmed schedule soon for the upcoming Trainings.

Online Assessment test

After the Training, the participants need to complete listening to all the tutorials and practice well including solving the assignment questions. This revision needs to be done at least 2 times so that the students are ready to take the online test. The organiser needs to keep a watch that proper revision is being done. Total time taken can be anywhere from 2 weeks to 1 month or even more. Fix the online test date after confirming that all students have practiced well.


Please note that an invigilator is required for the online test. For this, identify a faculty member who can invigilate the test and help him/her register on the {0} website before you make a test request.
