====================================

PycURL is a Python interface to `libcurl`_. PycURL can be used to fetch objects
identified by a URL from a Python program, similar to the `urllib`_ Python module.
PycURL is mature, very fast, and supports a lot of features.

Overview
--------

- libcurl is a free and easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library, supporting
  FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, TELNET, DICT, LDAP, LDAPS, FILE, IMAP,
  SMTP, POP3 and RTSP. libcurl supports SSL certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT,
  FTP uploading, HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password
  authentication  (Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate, Kerberos4), file transfer
  resume, http proxy tunneling and more!

- libcurl is highly portable, it builds and works identically on numerous
  platforms, including Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin, HPUX, IRIX,
  AIX, Tru64, Linux, UnixWare, HURD, Windows, Amiga, OS/2, BeOs, Mac OS X,
  Ultrix, QNX, OpenVMS, RISC OS, Novell NetWare, DOS and more...

- libcurl is `free`_, `thread-safe`_, `IPv6 compatible`_, `feature rich`_,
  `well supported`_, `fast`_, `thoroughly documented`_ and is already used by
  many known, big and successful `companies`_ and numerous `applications`_.

Requirements
------------

- Python 2.4 through 2.7 or 3.1 through 3.4.
- libcurl 7.19.0 or better.

Installation
------------

Please see INSTALL.rst for installation instructions. If installing from
a Git checkout, please follow instruction in the "Git Checkout" section
in INSTALL.rst.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for the most recent PycURL release is available on
`PycURL website <http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/doc/>`_.

To build documentation from source, run ``make docs``.
Building documentation requires `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ to
be installed, as well as pycurl extension module built as docstrings are
extracted from it. Built documentation is stored in ``build/doc``
subdirectory.

Support
-------

For support questions, please use `curl-and-python mailing list`_.
`Mailing list archives`_ are available for your perusal as well.

Although not an official support venue, `Stack Overflow`_ has been quite
popular with PycURL users as well.

Bugs can be reported `via GitHub`_. Please only use GitHub issues when you are
certain you have found a bug in PycURL. If you do not have a patch to fix
the bug, or at least a specific code fragment in PycURL that you believe is
the cause, you should instead post your inquiry to the mailing list.

Automated Tests
---------------

PycURL comes with an automated test suite. To run the tests, execute::

    make test

The suite depends on packages `nose`_ and `bottle`_, as well as `vsftpd`_.

Some tests use vsftpd configured to accept anonymous uploads. These tests
are not run by default. As configured, vsftpd will allow reads and writes to
anything the user running the tests has read and write access. To run
vsftpd tests you must explicitly set PYCURL_VSFTPD_PATH variable like so::

    # use vsftpd in PATH
    export PYCURL_VSFTPD_PATH=vsftpd

    # specify full path to vsftpd
    export PYCURL_VSFTPD_PATH=/usr/local/libexec/vsftpd

These instructions work for Python 2.5 through 2.7 and 3.1 through 3.4.

.. _bottle: http://bottlepy.org/
.. _vsftpd: http://vsftpd.beasts.org/

Test Matrix
-----------

The test matrix is a separate framework that runs tests on more esoteric
configurations. It supports:

- Testing against Python 2.4, which bottle does not support.
- Testing against Python compiled without threads, which requires an out of
  process test server.
- Testing against locally compiled libcurl with arbitrary options.

To use the test matrix, first you need to start the test server from
Python 2.5+ by running::

    python -m tests.appmanager

Then in a different shell, and preferably in a separate user account,
run the test matrix::

    # run ftp tests, etc.
    export PYCURL_VSFTPD_PATH=vsftpd
    # create a new work directory, preferably not under pycurl tree
    mkdir testmatrix
    cd testmatrix
    # run the matrix specifying absolute path
    python /path/to/pycurl/tests/matrix.py

The test matrix will download, build and install supported Python versions
and supported libcurl versions, then run pycurl tests against each combination.
To see what the combinations are, look in
`tests/matrix.py <tests/matrix.py>`_.

Contribute
----------

For smaller changes:

#. Fork `the repository`_ on Github.
#. Create a branch off **master**.
#. Make your changes.
#. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature
   works as expected.
#. Send a pull request.
#. Check back after 10-15 minutes to see if tests passed on Travis CI.
   PycURL supports old Python and libcurl releases and their support is tested
   on Travis.

For larger changes:

#. Join the `mailing list`_.
#. Discuss your proposal on the mailing list.
#. When consensus is reached, implement it as described above.

Please contribute binary distributions for your system to the
`downloads repository`_.
